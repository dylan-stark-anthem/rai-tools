# How to Contribute to raitools

This guide covers many important topics for contributing to the development of `raitools`.


## Style guide & documentation

We follow [Google's style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and [Google's documentation style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for our docs.
Of course there will always be exceptions, which we'll implement directly via the reformatter, style guide checker, and static analyzer, or some other part of our build system (e.g., [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)).
And whatever we can't codify, we'll note here.
